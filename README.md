Village Bajedhi: Socio-Economic Gap Analysis
A Power BI Data Visualization Project for Rural Development

Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive socio-economic analysis of Village Bajedhi. By transforming raw survey data into an interactive Power BI dashboard, I identified critical development gaps in health, education, and women’s empowerment. The goal is to provide data-backed insights for local administrators to prioritize resource allocation.

🚀 Key Dashboard Pages
Demography: Analysis of caste distribution, occupation, and income levels.

Health & Sanitation: Tracking toilet availability and health scheme reach.

Education & Digital Literacy: Identifying school dropout rates and the digital divide.

Women's Empowerment: Measuring SHG participation and financial decision-making power.

🔍 Major "Gap Analysis" Findings
The core of this project focuses on where the village is falling behind. Key gaps identified include:

The Digital Divide: X% of households have no access to digital devices, limiting access to online government services.

Sanitation Coverage: While awareness is high, there is a Y% gap between households and functional toilet facilities.

The "Knowledge-Action" Gap: Z% of the population is aware of the PM POSHAN scheme, but only A% have successfully availed its benefits.

Education Leaks: Financial constraints remain the #1 driver for school dropouts among male-headed households.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Tool: Microsoft Power BI Desktop

Data Source: CSV/Excel (Survey Data)

Techniques Used:

DAX: Created custom measures for Gap %, Achievement Rates, and Total Population.

Power Query: Data cleaning, "Trimming" hidden spaces, and data type transformation.

UI/UX: Implemented sidebar navigation and a professional color palette (Navy/Teal/Plum).
